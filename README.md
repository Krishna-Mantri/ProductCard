---

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v12 or above recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

---

npm install


---

## Available Scripts

Within the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view in the browser.  
The page reloads on code changes and displays lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Bundles the app for production into the `build` folder.  
Optimizes React for best performance.  
Build artifacts are minified and filenames include hashes.  
The app is ready to be deployed.

### `npm run eject`

**Warning:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot go back!  
It removes the single build dependency from the project and copies configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project for customization.
